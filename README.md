# SSA_Mangrove_FCH4
The code scripts are for the application of singular spectrum analysis on decomposing and reconstructing 200-day eddy covariance CH4 flux for a mangrove wetland in Hong Kong.

To reduce edge effects, we extended the 200d time series of FCH4 to 600 days by replicating it.

Three-year eddy covariance FCH4 data can be downloaded from http://sites.fluxdata.org/HK-MPM/, under the data policy of FLUXNET
